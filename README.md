# Hospital Mortality Prediction
SQL & Data Analytics Project ‚Äì Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality  

## Project Overview  
This project explores patient survival data to identify the **key predictors of in-hospital mortality**.  
By analyzing demographic, clinical, and ICU-related attributes, the goal was to uncover actionable insights that can help healthcare professionals develop targeted interventions and evidence-based protocols.  

---

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess patient data for SQL analysis.  
- Identify mortality trends across **age, gender, ethnicity, ICU sources, comorbidities, and vital signs**.  
- Calculate mortality rates, probabilities, and risk factors using SQL queries.    

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL / MySQL** ‚Äì Data cleaning, querying, aggregation, probability analysis  
- **Excel** ‚Äì Initial data cleaning and formatting  
- **Data Analysis** ‚Äì Identifying anomalies, trends, and correlations  

---

## Key SQL Analyses  
- **Data Cleaning:** Replaced missing values (e.g., ethnicity) to ensure consistency.  
- **Mortality Trends:** Calculated total hospital deaths (6.34%) and mortality rates by **age group, ethnicity, gender, and ICU type**.  
- **Comorbidity Impact:** Found that **diabetes, immunosuppression, and solid tumors** had the highest mortality risk.  
- **Physiological Factors:** Analyzed weight, BMI, and heart rate among deceased patients, linking cardiovascular indicators with outcomes.  
- **ICU Analysis:** Discovered that patients in "Accident & Emergency" had the highest death count, while ‚ÄúFloor‚Äù had the highest death probability (11.76%).  

---

## Insights & Outcomes  
- **Age** is a strong predictor: nearly **20% mortality in patients 70+ years old**.  
- **Diabetes** emerged as the top comorbidity linked with mortality (**24.45% mortality rate**).  
- **Elevated heart rate** (average 115 bpm in deceased patients) was associated with higher risk.  
- **ICU length of stay** strongly correlated with survival ‚Äî shorter stays meant better outcomes.

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how **SQL-based analysis** can extract meaningful insights from healthcare data.  
The results can help healthcare teams **prioritize high-risk patients**, design **preventive interventions**, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
